## Overview

This is a solution to the [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) challenge to build a <b>Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts</b>. [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) is a platform to learn and build <b>Web3</b> projects alongside other devs.

This repo contains the front-end <b>React</b> code for my <b>Web3</b> app.  You can view the repo for the <b>Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts</b> [here](https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/waveportal-smart-contract).

I built this project so that I could learn some <b>Solidity</b>, write + deploy a <b>smart contract</b> to the <b>blockchain</b>, and build a <b>Web3 client</b> app that can <b>interact</b> with your a <b>smart contract</b>, and to basically get comfortable building an entire Web3 App. 

## The challenge

### Users should be able to:

- [x] <b>View</b> landing page and understand the purpose of this app
- [x] <b>Connect</b> their ethereum <b>wallet</b> using Metamask, with the Rinkeby Test Network
- [x] <b>Input a message</b> and click button to send a "wave" to the smart contract owner
- [x] Once the "wave" is sent, the "waver" is entered to <b>win a prize</b> where the winner is chosen at random
- [x] While the user is waiting for their transaction to be mined on the blockchain a <b>loading message</b> is displayed to the UI. Because of <b>blocktime</b> this message may be displayed for 15+ seconds
- [x] The <b>number of "wavers"</b> is displayed along with each wavers <b>address</b>, <b>time</b> that wave was sent, and a <b>message</b>.

### Smart Contract should be able to:

- [x] <b>Deploy</b> your WavePortal <b>smart contract</b> to a local <b>Ethereum network</b>
- [x] <b>Connect to our wallet</b> and talks to our WaveContract
- [x] <b>Update WavePortal</b> to randomly send lucky users waving at you some Ethereum
- [x] <b>Update UI</b> + <b>deploy</b> to an <b>Ethereum testnet</b> so anyone on the internet can wave at you using their wallet

## My process

### Built with

- Front-end
    - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Framework
        - [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) Components
    - CSS Flexbox
- [Smart-Contract](https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/waveportal-smart-contract)
    - [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/)
        - [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)
        - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
    - [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
    - [Rinkeby Test Net](https://www.rinkeby.io/)
        - [Rinkeby Faucet](https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com/)
        - [Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)
    - [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

### What I learned

This was a useful and rewarding project for me.  I became interested in Web3 and solidity and I really wanted to build a complete project because I knew that would be the most effect way to learn.  I ran into ALOT of roadblocks in previous projects because Web3/solditity is a fairly new technology that is being continuously updated, and it's very hard to find documentation and resources that will work with different versions of solidity. 

This was my first successful completed Web3 project. I really enjoyed that buildspace showed the step by step process of building a complete Web3 project and providing a community that you can utilized to get help when you run into any blockers. 

One of the main tools that helped me complete this project was [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), which allows you to deploy your contracts, run tests and debug Solidity code without dealing with live environments. 

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->



### Continued development

There are a few things that I would like to revist when I have the time.  The prize functionality is build into the smart contract, but I would like to add some feedback to the UI so that the user willl know that they entered the contest and alert them if they win.  I would also like to add UI feedback for any issues we may encouter, such as running out of gas, etc.


#### To-Do's

- [x] Fix `useEffect` for new wave events
- [x] Add alerts for out of gas, etc.
- [ ] Clean up
- [x] Deploy
- [x] write README.md
- [ ] add UI feedback and information for prize

### Useful resources

-  [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), which allows you to deploy your contracts, run tests and debug Solidity code without dealing with live environments. This really helped me understand how to build a smart contract in JavaScript kind of way.
- [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).  I used <b>Semantic UI Components</b> for the input box and the table that displays the waver's information.  I didn't want to spend a ton of time on these elements because the focus of this project was to build a fully functional smart contract.
